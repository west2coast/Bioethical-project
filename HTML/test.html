                    Dear Dr./Prof. <input type = "text" id = "Lastname" placeholder = "Last Name"/>, <br><br>

We have received the reports from our advisers on your manuscript, "<input type = "text" id = "Arttitle" placeholder = "Article Title"/>",  which you submitted to the <i>Journal of Bioethical Inquiry</i> (http://bioethicalinquiry.com/). <br><br>

I am pleased to inform you that it has been accepted for publication, on condition you attend to minor revisions (see reviewers’ assessments at the end of this message) as well as any needed reference/stylistic revisions.<br><br>
                    In order to submit your revised manuscript, please visit this website: <input type = "text" id = "Weblink" placeholder = "Web URL"/>
                    <br><br>
                    Your Login: <input type = "text" id = "Logname" placeholder = "Login Name"/>

                    <br><br>
                    
When you submit your revised manuscript, please use "track changes" and outline in a covering letter how you have responded to the reviewers’ comments. <br><br>
                    Also, please note that the resubmitted manuscript should comply with the <i>JBI</i>’s referencing system and formatting, which can be located at http://bioethicalinquiry.com/jbi-style-guide/references/ and http://bioethicalinquiry.com/jbi-style-guide/formatting/. In general, please use in-text citations (not footnotes) within the body of the article, and when formatting references, please use “Sentence case” and not “Title Case” for titles of books and articles and include both the volume AND issue number for journal citations, etc. Examples of several kinds of in-text citations and references are available on our website at the links provided.
                    <br><br>
                    
 As applicable, our publisher also discourages footnotes and endnotes and prefers that they are limited to no more than six (6).
                    <br><br>
                    We are looking forward to receiving your revised manuscript.
