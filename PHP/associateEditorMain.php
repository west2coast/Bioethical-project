                                        As the Associate Editor for a manuscript, you are responsible for overseeing the peer-review process, which is an essential and vital tool for the publication of quality scholarship and for fostering constructive dialogue within and across disciplines. It provides advice and assistance to authors to help them improve and develop their manuscripts, and it facilitates the development and dissemination of knowledge in vetted academic resources.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Based on the peer reviews you receive (a minimum of two) as well as your own review of the paper, you will advise the journal about whether a manuscript should be published.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Please do not make any comments in your suggested decision that you do not wish the author(s) to see. (You may indicate some comments directed only to the editor; if so, please indicate these areas clearly.) Even if a paper is not accepted for publication, the <i>JBI</i> forwards critiques and suggestions that might help authors improve their papers. References in support of comments are encouraged.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Manuscripts submitted to the <i>Journal of Bioethical Inquiry</i> are confidential documents. Please do not discuss them with anyone.

                                            <li>Making use of confidential information to achieve personal or professional gain; and</li>
                                            <li>Using ideas or text from a manuscript under review.</li>

                                                <li>Also determine if the writing and level of scholarship are executed well enough to be deemed ready for peer review.</li>
