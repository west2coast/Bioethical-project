                                        The peer-review process is an essential and vital tool for the publication of quality scholarship and for fostering constructive dialogue within and across disciplines. It provides advice and assistance to authors to help them improve and develop their manuscripts, and it facilitates the development and dissemination of knowledge in vetted academic resources.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> As a reviewer, you will be advising both the authors and the editors, who will make the final decision about whether to publish a manuscript. The editors will send your review to the author(s) at their discretion. Reviewers do not have to sign their reviews-thereby identifying themselves to the author(s)-unless they choose to do so.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Please do not make any comments you do not wish the author(s) to see. (You may indicate some comments directed only to the editors; if so, please indicate these areas clearly in your review.)
                                        <br>
                                        <br> The review process can and should help authors develop their knowledge and abilities. Criticism should be reasoned, courteous, constructive, and sufficiently detailed to (1) help the editors make an informed decision and (2) assist the authors with areas for improvement. Even if a paper is not accepted for publication, the <i>JBI</i> will forward critiques and suggestions that might help authors improve their papers. References in support of comments are encouraged.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Manuscripts submitted to the <i>Journal of Bioethical Inquiry</i> are confidential documents. Please do not discuss them with anyone.

                                            <li>Unfairly criticizing a competitor's work;</li>
                                            <li>Breaching authors' confidentiality;</li>
                                            <li>Proposing changes that appear to support the reviewer's own work or hypotheses;</li>
                                            <li>Making use of confidential information to achieve personal or professional gain; and</li>
                                            <li>Using ideas or text from a manuscript under review.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h4>Submitting a Review</h4> In assessing a manuscript as to its suitability for publication, please provide constructive feedback and substantiate any comments you make on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper.
